# ---------------Start your code for Question 1 below ------------------- #
#=========================================================================#

# Before combining the datasets, you can think about how to combine
# the available datasets. Here are a few things to consider:
# 1. The spelling of the state, and county name in "county_outlines" 
# and the "local_food" are different, we need to find a dataset in 
# the middle (for example, "county_fips") to help joining the datasets.  

# 2. You may change the spelling of the state and county to lower in county fips data, 
# so that it can be combined with the county_outlines data

# Question 1:
# Before combining the datasets we must fix the counties of each data set
# so they both match up. We can do this changing the local_foods dataset
# to lowercase and adding the word " county" to the end of the county_outlines
# dataset.

# Change State Name
